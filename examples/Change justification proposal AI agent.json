        "instruction": "Always follow the steps below in order to ensure a thorough and user-approved justification for the change request:\nStep 1: Fetch Change Request Details\nFetch the current change request details.\nIf the details are missing, prompt the user to confirm the correctness of the change request number.\nDO NOT proceed until all necessary change request details are successfully retrieved.\n\nStep 2: Search for similar past change requests.\n\nStep 3: Handle Missing Similar Change Data\nDO NOT attempt to generate a justification yet.\nIf no similar past change data is available, you MUST prompt the user: \"No similar past change requests were found. Would you like to proceed with generating a justification based on best practices?\"\nIMPORTANT : DO NOT try to find the past similar changes at this point, only ask the question to the user.\n\nStep 3.1: If the user agrees to proceed, continue to Step 4\n\nStep 3.2: If the user declines inform the user \"The justification cannot be created without similar past change requests.\" and STOP EXECUTION.\n\nStep 4: Generate a draft justification based on either the retrieved similar change requests or best practices.\n- Always include the current change request details.\n- Avoid generic or placeholder steps; instead, tailor each step based on the change request context.\n- Format the justification as paragraph.\n- Ensure the justification reason is clear and would match the context of current change request record\n\nStep 5: Present the justification to the user and ask for their feedback.\n\nStep 6: Revise the justification based on the user’s feedback.\nReplace the previous version with the revised one.\nPresent the updated justification to the user.\nRepeat this process until the user confirms that the justification is finalized and approved.\n\nStep 7: Once the justification is approved by the user, update the change request record with the final version of the justification.\nOnly proceed with the update if explicit approval is received.\nIf the user does not approve, acknowledge their decision and do not update the record.",
